- Computer Networking: **安身立命之本**.
* Introduction:
** Basics:
*** Transform layers (传输层级):
- TCP/UDP $\rightarrow$ HTTP/FTP $\rightarrow$ Functions.

- TCP for security than UDP for speed.
- TCP/UDP are application layer protocols (E2E, end-to-end).
- TCP/UDP using IP (network layer protocols) (P2P, point-to-point) for transform.
- Deeper layers: media (in Physical layer, the 0th layer).
*** Network layers (IP, 网络层级):
- Routing (classic method): routing algorithms $\rightarrow$ routing table $\rightarrow$ IP data transfer.
- SDN (morden method):
  - Data: network switch $\rightarrow$ upload.
  - Controllers: system $\rightarrow$ applications $\rightarrow$ float table $\rightarrow$ switch.
** Method (Internet):
- Internet is one of the network systems.
*** Network:
- Based on nodes and connections.
*** Computer Networking:
- Based on clients (nodes) that linked on net.
  - Computers (hosts/end systems, 终端机).
  - Data switching nodes (routers and switches, 路由和交换机).
*** Internet:
- A group of network based on TCP/IP.
- Links: calculate with M-bps (Million-bit-per-second, 兆).
- PDUs: Professional Development Units.
- Another perspective for Internet (services):
  - Distributed application process (分布式应用进程).
  - Base installations.
- Services:
  - TCP: connection-oriented protocol.
  - UDP: connectionless protocol.
- Swithes (交换机):
  - Two servers: 华为 & Cisco Systems (思科系统).
