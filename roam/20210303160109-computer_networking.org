- Computer Networking: 安身立命之本.
* Introduction:
** Basic:
*** Transform layers:
- TCP/UDP $\rightarrow$ HTTP/FTP $\rightarrow$ Functions.

- TCP for security than UDP for speed.
- TCP/UDP are application layer protocols (E2E, end-to-end).
- TCP/UDP using IP (network layer protocols) (P2P, point-to-point) for transform.
- Deeper layers: media (in Physical layer, the 0th layer).
*** Network layers (IP):
- Routing (classic method): routing algorithms $\rightarrow$ routing table $\rightarrow$ IP data transfer.
- SDN (morden method):
  - Data: network switch $\rightarrow$ upload.
  - Controllers: system $\rightarrow$ applications $\rightarrow$ float table $\rightarrow$ switch.
** Method (Internet):
- Internet is one of the network systems.
*** Network:
- Based on nodes and links.
*** Computer Networking:
- Based on clients (nodes) that linked on net.
  - Computers (hosts/end systems).
  - Data switching nodes (packets: routers and switches).
*** Internet:
- A group of network based on TCP/IP.
- Links: calculate with bps (bit-per-second).
- PDUs: Professional Development Units.
- Another perspective for Internet (services):
  - Distributed application process.
  - Base installations.
- Services:
  - TCP: connection-oriented protocol.
  - UDP: connectionless protocol.
