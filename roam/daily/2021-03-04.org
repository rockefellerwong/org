** Most important thing:

** We should remember the color: #e43501 for 红色 · 中国.

** 全国政协 stands for 中国人民政治协商会议.

** I found a interesting word called "吃瓜" that can be described as:
- Someone cares for something just for fun.
- It is meaningless and it wastes time.

** There are some problems for now:
- Decline in fertility.
- The increase of the rate in young people's sudden-death.
- The terrible value increase in Bitcoins from 2021.

* After dinner, boring now.
- If you ask me why I prefer Emacs than Notion or Roam Research, I'll say just cause I can.
- A beautiful equation (proved by myself several months ago):

  cause: $n^{3}=n^{2} \cdot n=n \cdot\left(n^{2}-n\right)+n^{2}=n \cdot\left(n^{2}-n\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2 i-1=\sum_{i=1}^{n} n^{2}-n+2 i-1$,
  so: $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^{3}=\sum_{i=1}^{\frac{1}{2} n(n+1)} 2 i-1=\left(\frac{1}{2} n(n+1)\right)^{2}=\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i\right)^{2}$.
